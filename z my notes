create S3 ----->  create CodePipeline -----> link CodePipeline to GitHub & S3 -----> Test it


-----------------------------------------


1) "Fork" the project in github

2) in AWS, create S3 bucket 
      bucket name
      uncheck "block all public access" so everyone can access the game
      create bucket

3) click the bucket name --> goto "Properties Tab"
      scroll to the bottom --> find the "Static website hosting"
      click "edit" --> "enable"
      index document --> input "index.html"
      save changes

4) click the bucket name --> goto "Permission Tab"
      add a bucket policy, otherwise people are not going to see our game
      copy and paste below in the box
      save changes
------------------------------------------
      {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    	{
        	"Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
        	"Effect": "Allow",                         ---> = allow
        	"Principal": "*",                          ---> = everybody = *
        	"Action": [
            	"s3:GetObject"                         ---> = to read 
        	],
        	"Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"         ---> = all file in our bucket, change the bucket name to your bucket name, eg."cloudproject01-codepipeline-s2-game" 
        	]
    	}
    ]
}

------------------------------------------

5) in AWS, goto CodePipeline
        create pipeline
        click "build custom pipeline"
        assign name (no symbol, this is the place always get you error at the end)
        Queued
        New service role 
        Next

        source provider --> GitHub App
        Click "Connect to GitHub" button 
              assign name for the connection
              click "connect to github"

              click "install a new app" button (to make the connection)
              it will goto your Github account
                  scroll down to bottom, find the "Repository access"
                  click "Only select repositories" --> choose the repository you want to connect
                  in the "Connect to GitHub" page --> click "Connect"
                            
6) go back to AWS CodePipeline
        the "Connection" box should be updated with the connection you just create, select that
        choose the correct "Repository name"
        in "Trigger", select "No filter"
        Next

        choose "skip the build stage"

        in "add deploy stage"

  7) Test the page
          goback to S3, in "properties tab", scroll to bottom and open the URL for the game
          (this URL can be share with others)

          go back to GitHub, make a change to the html file
          click "commit change"
          go to AWS Codepipeline, you will find Codepipeline detected a change in github and redeploy for us automatically


  Finish
